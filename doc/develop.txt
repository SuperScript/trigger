== The Package Structure

This package follows some simple conventions for managing source code and
documentation.

=== Source Directories
These directories are part of the repository or distribution tarball.

+src+::	    Where source code resides.
+doc+::	    Where documentation sources reside.
+package+:: Where packaging scripts reside.

=== Build Directories
These directories are created on demand as part of the build process.

+compile+::	Where source code is compiled.
+command+::	Where executables are copied.
+compile-doc+:: Where documentation is compiled.
+html+::	Where documentation is copied.

=== Other Directories

+dist+:: Where versioned distribution files are copied.

== Create A Distribution File

A package distribution file contains a single package version configured for
installation under +/package+.  To create the package, run the command:
!!!!
package/dist
!!!!
This creates a tarball in the +dist/+ directory.  The version comes from the
last nonempty line in +package/versions+.  The path under +/package+ comes from
the first line in +package/path+.  And the package name comes from the first
line in +package/name+.

It is customary to run +package/dist+ as root when preparing a package for
distribution.


== Create Makefiles
These commands require the http://www.superscript.com/software/build/[build]
package.

Build +mkfile+ and replace +Makefile+ for the source directory:
!!!!
package/build mkfile
cp compile/mkfile src/Makefile
!!!!

Create a Makefile for documentation in similar fashion:
!!!!
package/docs -b build mkfile
cp compile-doc/mkfile doc/Makefile
!!!!
