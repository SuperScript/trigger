== NAME
trigger-listen - listen to a fifo and execute a command

== SYNOPSIS
!!!!
trigger-listen [ -UdDqQv1 -c _limit_ -t _timeout_ -i _interval_ -g _gid_ -u _uid_ ] _path_ _prog_
!!!!

== DESCRIPTION
The +trigger-listen+ program listens for input on the fifo +_path_+.  When
it receives input +trigger-listen+ invokes +_prog_+ and continues to
listen for input on +_path_+.  An external program pulls the trigger by
writing a byte of data to +_path_+.  The +trigger-listen+ does not examine input
data.

== OPTIONS

=== GENERAL OPTIONS
+-q+::
Quiet.  Do not print error messages.

+-Q+:: 
Print error messages. (Default)

+-v+::
Verbose.  Print both status and error messages.


=== LISTENING OPTIONS
+-1+::
Execute +_prog_+ immediately upon startup.

+-c _limit_+::
Execute at most +_limit_+ copies of +_prog_+ concurrently.  If a
trigger pull occurs while +_limit_+ copies are running,
+trigger-listen+ executes +_prog_+ as soon as one of the running
copies exits.

+-t _timeout_+::
Wait at most +_timeout_+ seconds for a trigger pull.  If
+_timeout_+
seconds elapse without a trigger pull, then +trigger-listen+ pulls
its own trigger.  The default value of +_timeout_+
is +(unsigned int)~0+.

+-i _interval_+::
Wait at least +_interval_+ seconds between executions of
+_prog_+.  If
it receives a trigger pull within +_interval_+ seconds of the last
execution, +trigger-listen+ executes +_prog_+ when
+_interval_+
seconds have elapsed.  The default value of +_interval_+ is 0.

+-g _gid_+::
Switch group ID to +_gid_+ after preparing to receive trigger pulls.

+-u _uid_+::
Switch user ID to +_uid_+ after preparing to receive connections.

+-U+::
Same as +-g $GID -u $UID+.  Typically, +$GID+ and +$UID+ are
set by http://cr.yp.to/daemontools/envuidgid.html[+envuidgid+].

+-d+:: 
Delete.  Remove and recreate the fifo +_path_+ upon startup. (Default)

+-D+::
No delete.  Do not remove and recreate +_path_+ upon startup.


== EXIT STATUS
The +trigger-listen+ program exits 111 for temporary errors and 100 for
permanent errors.  It exits 0 on success or when terminated by signal.


== EXAMPLES
!!!!
trigger-listen ./trigger echo \'Hello world!'
