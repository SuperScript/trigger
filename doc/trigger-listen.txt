:doctype: manpage

== NAME
trigger-listen - listen to a fifo(7) and execute a command


== SYNOPSIS
!!!!
+trigger-listen+ [ +-UdDqQv1+ +-c+ +_limit_+ +-t+ +_timeout_+ +-i+ +_interval_+ +-g+ +_gid_+ +-u+ +_uid_+ ] +_path_+ +_prog_+
!!!!


== DESCRIPTION
The +trigger-listen+ program listens for input on the +fifo(7)+ +_path_+ using
+read(2)+.  When it receives input +trigger-listen+ invokes +_prog_+ and
continues to listen for input on +_path_+.  An external program pulls the
trigger by writing a byte of data to +_path_+.  The +trigger-listen+ program
does not examine input data.


== OPTIONS

=== GENERAL OPTIONS
+-q+::
Quiet.  Do not print error messages.

+-Q+::
Print error messages. (Default)

+-v+::
Verbose.  Print both status and error messages.

=== LISTENING OPTIONS
+-1+::
Execute +_prog_+ immediately upon startup.

+-c _limit_+::
Execute at most +_limit_+ copies of +_prog_+ concurrently.  If a
trigger pull occurs while +_limit_+ copies are running,
+trigger-listen+ executes +_prog_+ as soon as one of the running
copies exits.

+-t _timeout_+::
Wait at most +_timeout_+ seconds for a trigger pull.  If +_timeout_+
seconds elapse without a trigger pull, then +trigger-listen+ pulls
its own trigger.  (Default: +(unsigned int)~0+)

+-i _interval_+::
Wait at least +_interval_+ seconds between executions of
+_prog_+.  If +trigger-listen+ receives a trigger pull within +_interval_+
seconds of the last execution, +trigger-listen+ executes +_prog_+ when
+_interval_+ seconds have elapsed.  (Default: 0).

+-g _gid_+::
Set the effective group ID to +_gid_+ using +setgid(2)+ after preparing to
receive trigger pulls.

+-u _uid_+::
Set the effective user ID to +_uid_+ using +setuid(2)+ after preparing to
receive trigger pulls.

+-U+::
Set the effective user ID to the +environ(7)+ variable +_UID_+ and the
effective group ID to the +environ(7)+ variable +_GID_+ after preparing to
receive trigger pulls.  Same as +-g+ +_$GID_+ +-u+ +_$UID_+, where +_$UID_+
and +_$GID_+ are typically set by
http://cr.yp.to/daemontools/envuidgid.html[+envuidgid(8)+].

+-d+::
Delete.  Remove and recreate the +fifo(7)+ +_path_+ upon startup. (Default)

+-D+::
No delete.  Do not remove and recreate +_path_+ upon startup.


== EXIT STATUS
The +trigger-listen+ program exits 111 for temporary errors and 100 for
permanent errors.  +trigger-listen+ exits 0 on success or when terminated by
signal.


== EXAMPLES
!!!!
+trigger-listen+ ./trigger echo \'Hello world!'
