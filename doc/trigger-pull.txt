+trigger-pull+ +_path_+

== DESCRIPTION

data to +_path_+.

== EXIT STATUS
The +trigger-pull+ program exits 100 for incorrect usage and 111 for temporary
errors.  It does not retry if the +write(2)+ would have blocked and it ignores the
lack of reader on the +fifo(7)+ +_path_+, treating these as successes.
