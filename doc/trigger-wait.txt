:doctype: manpage

== NAME
trigger-wait - listen to a trigger and optionally execute a command

== SYNOPSIS
!!!!
trigger-wait [ -wWdD -t _timeout_ ] _path_ [ _prog_ ]
!!!!


== DESCRIPTION
The +trigger-wait+ program listens for input on the fifo +_path_+.  If +_prog_+ is
present, +trigger-wait+ executes it and optionally waits for it to complete.  It
then exits 0 if it received a trigger pull and 99 otherwise.


=== OPTIONS
+-t _timeout_+::
Wait at most +_timeout_+ seconds for a trigger pull.  If +_timeout_+
seconds elapse without a trigger pull, then +trigger-wait+ pulls
its own trigger.  The default value of +_timeout_+
is +(unsigned int)~0+.

+-w+::
Wait for +_prog_+ to complete. (Default)

+-W+::
Do not wait for +_prog_+ to complete.

+-d+::
Delete.  Remove and recreate the fifo +_path_+ upon startup.  (Default)

+-D+::
No delete.  Do not remove and recreate +_path_+ upon startup.


== EXIT STATUS
The +trigger-wait+ program exits 100 for permanent
errors and 111 for temporary errors.  It exits 0 if it received a trigger pull,
and 99 otherwise.


== EXAMPLES
Assume that the processor for +/service/foo/log+ pulls the trigger as its dying
act:
!!!!
cd /service/foo && trigger-wait -t 5 ./trigger-rotate svc -a log
!!!!
