:doctype: manpage

== NAME
trigger-wait - listen to a fifo(7) and optionally execute a command

== SYNOPSIS
!!!!
+trigger-wait+ [ +-wWdD+ +-t+ _timeout_ ] _path_ [ _prog_ ]
!!!!


== DESCRIPTION
The +trigger-wait+ program listens for input on the +fifo(7)+ +_path_+ using
+read(2)+.  If +_prog_+ is present, +trigger-wait+ executes +_prog_+ and
optionally waits for it to complete.


=== OPTIONS
+-t _timeout_+::
Wait at most +_timeout_+ seconds for a trigger pull.  If +_timeout_+
seconds elapse without a trigger pull, then +trigger-wait+ pulls
its own trigger.  (Default: +(unsigned int)~0+)

+-w+::
Wait for +_prog_+ to complete before exit. (Default)

+-W+::
Do not wait for +_prog_+ to complete before exit.

+-d+::
Delete.  Remove and recreate the +fifo(7)+ +_path_+ upon startup.  (Default)

+-D+::
No delete.  Do not remove and recreate +_path_+ upon startup.


== EXIT STATUS
The +trigger-wait+ program exits 100 for permanent errors and 111 for
temporary errors.  It exits 0 if it received a trigger pull, and 99 otherwise.


== EXAMPLES
Assume that the processor for +_/service/foo/log_+ pulls the trigger as its
dying act:
!!!!
cd /service/foo && trigger-wait -t 5 ./trigger-rotate svc -a log
!!!!
